### URL Shortener using GO Lang

## Components

# 1. Front End

The frontend would be a simple website which has a input field to take the input
of url and return the shortened version. It will include two buttons and two
input fields so that the second one is used to redirect the shortened url to
it's original endpoint. The frontend application would be build using one of the
new framework which I have not used before

# 2. Backend

The backend would be written in plain GO lang. I would be using UUID4 to encode
the url and return the shortened version. I would be using a relational database
such as postgreSQL to maintain the mappings of the URLs
